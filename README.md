**Hello, there.** I’m a web developer based in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, right in the heart of Grand Teton National Park, on Shoshone-Bannock, Eastern Shoshone, and Cheyenne land. I live here with my spouse and our [two rambunctious kittens][pb], and we enjoy traveling and visiting national parks, historic sites, landmarks, and museums across the country.

I’ve been building websites for over 20 years, and currently I’m an engineering manager at [Stitch Fix][sf], where I've led multiple engineering and cross-functional teams, most recently the Omniclient team.

Previously, I was a senior engineering manager at [Vox Media][vm], where I led several teams, including the Editorial Tools team, building first-class editorial tools for journalists across the world; the Services team, bringing [Chorus][ch] to newspapers such as the _Chicago Sun-Times_, _Deseret News_, and _Minneapolis Star Tribune_; the Revenue Platforms team, building better advertising tools & products; and the Performance team, making the sites as fast as possible. I was also a front-end engineer at [_The Verge_][tv], where among other things I did a complete responsive rebuild of the site, and worked on high-touch editorial features such as [The Verge 50][v50].
